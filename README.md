# React Tetris

A simple tetris game using React!

I realize react probably isn't the best way to make games (even simple games like tetris) but I have a crazy passion for video games and wanted to mix this passion with my knowledge of React and Javascript that I learned from my time at Prime Digital Academy earlier this year.

I learned A LOT about custom hooks and styled components while creating this. Some of the functions went a bit over my head (such as "playerRotate" and "checkCollision") but writing these out helped me to conceptualize how even simple games sometimes require a lot of thinking and logic to create!
